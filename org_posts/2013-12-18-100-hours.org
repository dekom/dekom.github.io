Inspired by conversation on [[HN][this hacker news discussion]], I want
to experience the (presumed) growth from spending actually 100
meaningful hours on a given task.  This post will be routinely updated
with the progress I make along the way, with a time tracking table and
thoughts.

The task I have chosen is to strengthen my fundamental skills in data
structure and algorithms by going through the book /Introduction to
Algorithms (3rd Edition)/ by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein
([[MITPress][MIT Press]]).  In addition, I will be using [[Org][Org-mode]]'s
[[OrgClock][clocking feature]] to keep track of my time progress.
