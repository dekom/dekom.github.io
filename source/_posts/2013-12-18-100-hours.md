Inspired by conversation on [this hacker news discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6922348), I want
to experience the (presumed) growth from spending actually 100
meaningful hours on a given task.  This post will be routinely updated
with the progress I make along the way, with a time tracking table and
thoughts.

The task I have chosen is to strengthen my fundamental skills in data
structure and algorithms by going through the book *Introduction to
Algorithms (3rd Edition)* by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein
([MIT Press](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms/)).  In addition, I will be using [Org-mode](http://orgmode.org/)'s
[clocking feature](http://orgmode.org/manual/Clocking-commands.html) to keep track of my time progress.
