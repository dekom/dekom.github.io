* Description
  Track the progress of spending 100 hours of quality time
  on a given task.  The task I have chosen is to strengthen my
  fundamental skills in data structure and algorithms by going through
  the book "Introduction to Algorithms (3rd Edition)" by Cormen,
  Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein.

* Time Tracker
  Keep track of hours spent on tasks using Org-mode's clocking
  function.
** Divide and Conquer
